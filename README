Implementation of the STANK programming language.

Why STANK? (ST)ack based L(AN)guage that suc(K)s

I do not recommend torturing yourself by trying to use STANK. Unless you want to write a STANK
compiler in STANK to make the language self-hosted. That would be nice.

If you would like to try to use the STANK language, you can read the documentation first by
running $python3 stank.py Docs.stanky

You need python 3 and the click library for the program to run properly

TODO: 
goto - implement the goto token
elif - implement the else if token
else - implement the else token
CSTANK - implement STANK in C
SELFSTANK - make STANK self hosted by making STANK compilable then a compiler for STANK in STANK

OTHER:
language kinda trash. It is turing complete (turing.stanky), but that is not technically useful. If you need to use a stack based language for whatever reason, just use C and make a statically allocated array and an index. Or C++.

The python interpreter is incredibly slow as of now. 
(If you are just messing around, it will seem super fast),
but anything that requires actual computation will be incredibly slow.
This is because I made negative effort in actually making the inerpreter
actually good. It works, just uses a lot of string comparisons. 

You can see how much faster C or Python is than STANK.
Do this by compiling fib.c, and then running this, fib.py, and fib.stanky
