Implementation of the STANK programming language.

Why STANK? (ST)ack based L(AN)guage that suc(K)s

I do not recommend torturing yourself by trying to use STANK. Unless you want to write a STANK
compiler in STANK to make the language self-hosted. That would be nice.

If you would like to try to use the STANK language, you can read the documentation first by
running $python3 stank.py Docs.stanky

You need python 3 and the click library for the program to run properly

TODO: 
goto - implement the goto token
elif - implement the else if token
else - implement the else token
CSTANK - implement STANK in C
SELFSTANK - make STANK self hosted by making STANK compilable then a compiler for STANK in STANK

OTHER:
language kinda trash. If you need to use a stack based language for whatever reason, just use C and make a statically allocated array and an index. Or C++.
